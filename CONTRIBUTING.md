Contribute changes, including code and documentation, through *pull requests*. 

**New contributors**:
While it is important for a project to have well defined practices, don't feel like you need to read/understand all of it right away! 
At the very minimum, follow the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) and start with a draft pull request. We can work from there together! 🤓

**Development practices**:  
  - Use the [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). 
  - Follow the [ColPrac guide for collaborative practices](https://docs.sciml.ai/ColPrac/stable/).
  - Follow the [SciML style guide](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLStyle) 😎.
  - Familiarize yourself with the source code, documentation, testing, and CI in the repo, and update the documentation and testing when appropriate. 
  - Know that your submissions are understood to be under the same *MIT License* that covers the project. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:c.michelen.strofer@gmail.com) if that's a concern. 

The project's repository includes the following two files to assist developers:
  - `.JuliaFormatter.toml`: Should be used to format the code using [JuliaFormatter](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/stable/) before pushing.
  - `.project-words.txt`: A list of words that should be ignored by your spellchecker.
